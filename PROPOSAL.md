# A proposal to add non-owning indirection class templates `indirect` and `optional_indirect`

_Joseph Thomson \<joseph.thomson@gmail.com\>_

## Introduction

`indirect<T>` and `optional_indirect<T>` are high-level indirection types that reference objects of type `T` without implying ownership. An `indirect<T>` is an indirect reference to an object of type `T`, while an `optional_indirect<T>` is an _optional_ indirect reference to an object of type `T`. Both `indirect` and `optional_indirect` have reference-like construction semantics and pointer-like assignment and indirection semantics.

## <a name="motivation"></a>Motivation and scope

Modern C++ [guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) recommend against using pointers to manage dynamically allocated resources, arrays, strings and optional values, instead encouraging the use of higher-level abstractions such as [`std::unique_ptr`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr), [`std::shared_ptr`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr), [`std::vector`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector), [`std::array`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array), [`std::array_view`](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3851.pdf) _(not yet standardized)_, [`std::string`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string), [`std::string_view`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view) and [`std::optional`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional). These types provide:

* Compile-time safety
* Run-time safety
* Documentation of intent
* Modern, easy-to-use interfaces
* Resource management

However, no such high-level types are provided by the standard to act as non-owning references to other objects; thus, pointers are still widely used in modern C++ code for this purpose, despite presenting many of the same disadvantages that led to their replacement in other use cases. This is the role played by `indirect` and `optional_indirect`:

|          | Owned                                      | Non-Owned                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Single   | `unique_ptr` `shared_ptr` `optional`       | `indirect` `optional_indirect` |
| Array    | `array` `vector` `unique_ptr` `shared_ptr` | `array_view`                   |
| String   | `string`                                   | `string_view`                  |
| Iterator | â€”                                          | _assorted_                     |

### Current demand

A number of existing and proposed high-level types attempt to address similar problems, but none of them adequately fit the use cases for which `indirect` and `optional_indirect` are designed. Their existence, however, shows that demand exists for solutions to the problems addressed by `indirect` and `optional_indirect`. Discussions of these other types can be found in the [design section](#design) of this proposal:

* [Why not `optional<T&>`?](#design/why-not-optional-ref)
* [Why not `reference_wrapper<T>`?](#design/why-not-reference_wrapper)
* [Why not `observer_ptr<T>`?](#design/why-not-observer_ptr)
* [Why not `not_null<T*>`?](#design/why-not-not_null)

## <a name="impact"></a>Impact on the standard

This proposal adds a single header, `<indirect>` containing both `indirect` and `optional_indirect`, which depends on the `<optional>` header for `nullopt_t`, `nullopt` and `bad_optional_access`. The `<optional>` header and all other library components will be unaffected.

The proposal could be modified to separate the definitions of `indirect` and `optional_indirect` into two headers, `<indirect>` and `<optional_indirect>` respectively, which would remove the dependency of `<indirect>` on `<optional>`. Alternatively, the `optional_indirect` class could instead be added to the `<optional>` header.

The proposed additions can be implemented using C++11 library and language features only.

## <a name="design"></a>Design decisions

When design decisions are discussed here with reference to `indirect` only, assume that the discussion applies equally to `optional_indirect` unless otherwise stated. 

### <a name="design/construction-lvalue-ref"></a>Construction from `T&`

`T&` is implicitly convertible to `indirect<T>`, so the following is valid:

```c++
int i = {};
int j = {};
indirect<int> ii = i; // `ii` references `i`
ii = j; // `ii` now references `j`
```

Given that `indirect<T>` in many ways behaves like `T*`, and `T&` does not implicitly convert to `T*`, this behaviour may raise a few eyebrows.

One concern is that allowing conversion from `T&` and then providing access via the indirection operators (`*` and `->`) is asymmetrical and unlike anything currently in the standard library, and that we should avoid this combination because it goes against what users have come to expect from a pointer-like type. However, such behaviour is already present in the standard library type `optional`:

```c++
int i = {};
optional<int> oi = i;
int j = *oi;
```

If users can get used to using "pointer-like" indirection operators with a value-like type, then they can get used to "reference-like" construction from `T&` for a pointer-like type.

Another concern is that "rebinding" on reassignment is surprising behaviour; if `indirect<T>` is initiailized like a reference, users might expect assignment from `T&` to assign to the underlying object like a reference. However, rebinding on assignment is already the behaviour exhibited by `reference_wrapper`:

```c++
int i = {};
int j = {};
reference_wrapper<int> ri = i; // `ri` references `i`
ri = j; // `ri` now references `j`
```

This behaviour is arguably _more_ surprising with `reference_wrapper` given its otherwise reference-like semantics. It could be argued that a pointer-like type such as `indirect` would be expected to rebind on assignment, while a reference-like type such as `reference_wrapper` could reasonably be expected to assign to the underlying object. Thus, we feel confident that users will be comfortable with the rebinding semantics of `indirect`.

These concerns aside, why enable implicit conversion from `T&` in the first place? After all, `optional` is a _value_-like type and `reference_wrapper` is a _reference_-like type; maybe construction from `T&` isn't appropriate for _pointer_-like types. Why not just stick with construction from `T*`? Why rock the boat? The reason is code correctness. Implicit conversion is _more convenient_ than explicit construction, so users are more likely to use an implicit conversion over an explicit constructor, or a type that allows implicit conversion over an alternative type that does not. Therefore, if a using a particular conversion or type could result in code that is more "correct" than code where alternative conversions or types are used, it would be wise to consider making the more "correct" conversions implicit.

When considering whether or not to make a conversion implicit, our logic is that, because implicit conversions can happen without the explicit permission of the programmer, they should be enabled _if and only if_ they can reasonably be expected to be both logically correct _and_ safe in the vast majority of cases (there are, as always, exceptions to the rule). A conversion from type `A` to type `B` is _logically correct_ if the object of type `B` represents the same kind of thing as the object of type `A`. Logical correctness is important because, even if our code is behaviourally correct, logical errors in our design can lead to bad design choices and bugs later on. Logical correctness is usually enforced by the type system, but when low-level constructs such as pointers are involved, we often cannot rely on the type system to save us. An operation is _safe_ if it never invokes undefined behaviour or throws an exception. If an operation is unsafe, the user must account for potential undefined behaviour or exceptions, as failing to do so can lead to programming errors. Safety is particularly important for implicit conversions because users often don't realize that the conversion is happening at all.

In our case, both `indirect<T>` and `T&` are non-owning references to objects of type `T` (the lifetime of a temporary _can_ be extended by `T const&`, but ownership cannot be transferred as it could be with `T*`); they have no other meaning. Thus, implicit conversion from `T&` to `indirect<T>` is always logically correct. In addition, conversion from `T&` to `indirect<T>` is safe. Of course, `T&` _can_ theoretically reference an area of memory that doesn't contain a valid object, but by that point the user has already invoked undefined behaviour and all bets are off. Conversely, `T*` is _not_ always a non-owning reference to an object of type `T`; it could represent a dynamic resource to be managed, an array of objects, or even an iterator. Thus, implicit conversion from `T*` to `indirect<T>` is not always logically correct. In addition, conversion from `T*` to `indirect<T>` is not safe, because `indirect<T>` has no valid state corresponding to the null state of `T*`, so constructing `indirect<T>` from a null `T*` must either specify undefined behaviour or throw an exception. Thus, allowing implicit conversion from `T*` to `indirect<T>` would be incorrect; at most, `indirect<T>` should support _explicit_ construction from `T*` (discussed in the "[Construction from `T*`](#design/construction-ptr)" section).
